## **Inaccel announces record-breaking speed on facial detection test using an FPGA cluster**

[InAccel](https://inaccel.com/), a world-pioneer in the domain of FPGA-based
accelerators, has released an integrated framework that allows to utilize the
power of an FPGA cluster for face detection, see [news](https://www.design-reuse.com/news/48940/inaccel-facial-detection-fpga-cluster.html)
Specifically, InAccel has presented a demo in which a cluster of 8 FPGAs are
used to provide up to 1700 fps (supporting up to 56 cameras with 30 fps in 
a single server). The HLS implementation used unded the hood is the
face detection design proposed in our FPGA 2017 and FPGA 2018 papers, see 
[this](https://inaccel.com/accelerated-face-detection-on-a-cluster-of-8-alveo-fpga-cards/). See
