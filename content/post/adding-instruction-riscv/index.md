<!--more-->

This is a tutorial on how to add an instruction to the RISCV ISA, how to write program with the special instruction. I will also talk about how to add the new instruction to RISCV assembler and how to execute it on gem5.

First of all download and install the riscv-tools:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools.git
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ export RISCV=/path/to/install/riscv/toolchain
$ ./build.sh
```
This will build the riscv toolchain. Now we will add a "modulo" instruction to the ISA. The instruction and its semantics are given below:

```bash
mod r1, r2, r3

Semantics:
R[r1] = R[r2] % R[r3]
```
Open the file riscv-opcodes/opcodes, here you will be able to see the various opcodes and instruction bits assigned to various instructions. Assigned an unused instruction to modulo inst. 

```bash
sra     rd rs1 rs2 31..25=32 14..12=5 6..2=0x0C 1..0=3
or      rd rs1 rs2 31..25=0  14..12=6 6..2=0x0C 1..0=3
and     rd rs1 rs2 31..25=0  14..12=7 6..2=0x0C 1..0=3

mod     rd rs1 rs2 31..25=1  14..12=0 6..2=0x1A 1..0=3

addiw   rd rs1 imm12            14..12=0 6..2=0x06 1..0=3
slliw   rd rs1 31..25=0  shamtw 14..12=1 6..2=0x06 1..0=3
srliw   rd rs1 31..25=0  shamtw 14..12=5 6..2=0x06 1..0=3
sraiw   rd rs1 31..25=32 shamtw 14..12=5 6..2=0x06 1..0=3
```

Now run the following command:

```bash
cat opcodes-pseudo opcodes opcodes-rvc opcodes-rvc-pseudo opcodes-custom | ./parse-opcodes -c > ~/temp.h
```
Open file temp.h and you will find the following two lines:

```C
#define MATCH_MOD 0x200006b                                                    
#define MASK_MOD 0xfe00707f
```
Add these two lines in riscv-gnu-toolchain/riscv-binutils-gdb/include/opcode/riscv-opc.h

Now edit riscv-gnu-toolchain/riscv-binutils-gdb/opcodes/riscv-opc.c and add this line in the assignment of const struct riscv\_opcode riscv\_opcodes[]:

```C
const struct riscv_opcode riscv_opcodes[] =                                     
{                                                                               
/* name,      isa,   operands, match, mask, match_func, pinfo.  */              
{"unimp",     "C",   "",  0, 0xffffU,  match_opcode, 0 },                       
{"unimp",     "I",   "",  MATCH_CSRRW | (CSR_CYCLE << OP_SH_CSR), 0xffffffffU,  match_opcode, 0 }, /* csrw cycle, x0 */
{"ebreak",    "C",   "",  MATCH_C_EBREAK, MASK_C_EBREAK, match_opcode, INSN_ALIAS },
{"ebreak",    "I",   "",    MATCH_EBREAK, MASK_EBREAK, match_opcode, 0 },          
{"sbreak",    "C",   "",  MATCH_C_EBREAK, MASK_C_EBREAK, match_opcode, INSN_ALIAS },
{"sbreak",    "I",   "",    MATCH_EBREAK, MASK_EBREAK, match_opcode, INSN_ALIAS },
....
....
....
{"mod",       "I",   "d,s,t",  MATCH_MOD, MASK_MOD, match_opcode, 0 }
....
....
```

Now compile the riscv-gnu-toolchain again and you are done.

Lets write a program and see if the RISCV assembler can use the mod instruction:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a,b,c;
  a = 5;
  b = 2;
  asm volatile
  (
    "mod   %[z], %[x], %[y]\n\t"
    : [z] "=r" (c)
    : [x] "r" (a), [y] "r" (b)
  )  
 
  if ( c != 1 ){
     printf("\n[[FAILED]]\n");
     return -1;
  }
  
  printf("\n[[PASSED]]\n");

  return 0;
}
```

Compile it using the modified RISCV compiler

```bash
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc mod.c -o mod
```
Now do an object dump to see that the mod instruction is actually used:

```bash
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -dC mod > mod.dump
```

Now open mod.dump and you will be able to see that mod instruction has been used.

I will later add how you can modify the ISA simulator to test the newly added instruction and how you can modify gem5 to be able to exexcute this instruction.

# Adding the new instruction to gem5

To add the instruction gem5 we need to modify arch/riscv/decoder.isa like this:

```C
    0x33: decode FUNCT3 {
        format ROp {
            0x0: decode FUNCT7 {
                0x0: add({{
                    Rd = Rs1_sd + Rs2_sd;
                }});
                0x1: mul({{
                    Rd = Rs1_sd*Rs2_sd;
                }}, IntMultOp);
                0x10: mod({{
                    Rd = Rs1_sd % Rs2_sd;
                }});
                0x20: sub({{
                    Rd = Rs1_sd - Rs2_sd;
                }});
            }
```

Here 0x33 is the opcode and 0x10 is the the funct7. The details about different fields in the RISC-V ISA can be seen from page no. 50 of the manual [here](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-54.pdf).

Note the instruction matching in the assembler is done something like this:

```C
((insn ^ op->match) & op->mask) == 0;
```
See match_opcode() fucntion in riscv-gnu-toolchain/riscv-binutils-gdb/opcodes/riscv-opc.c 

op->match and op->mask are the MATCH and MASK macros that we defined.  

This means if you just see the 1 bits in the MATCH in the instruction and flip them,
and then see the mask bits then everything should be 0. MASK tells which bits are
of interest and MATCH tells what is the configuration required.

# Adding the custom instruction to spike ISA simulator

In the riscv-isa-sim/riscv/encoding.h add the following lines:

```
#define MATCH_MOD 0x200006b                                                    
#define MASK_MOD 0xfe00707f
...
DECLARE_INSN(mod, MATCH_MOD, MASK_MOD)
```
Create a file riscv-isa-sim/riscv/insns/mod.h and add these lines:

```
WRITE_RD(sext_xlen(RS1 % RS2));
```

Add this file to riscv-isa-sim/riscv/riscv.mk.in
```
riscv_insn_list = \
      ...
      mod \
      ...
```

In riscv-isa-sim/spike_main/disasm.cc add the following lines:

```
DEFINE_RTYPE(mod);
```

And now build riscv-tools again. The "mod" instruction has been added to spike
simulator
